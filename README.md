# Example use of `browser-sync`

Clone this repo or copy the package.json into the root directory of your Lambda School projects (assuming you have all your LS projects in one directory). Then run

```bash
$ npm i
```

You can start up a server with

```bash
$ npm start
```

This will give you a live server that hot-reloads any time an `html` or `css` file is saved in any of the subdirectories.
